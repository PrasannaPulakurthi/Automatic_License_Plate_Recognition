## Automatic License Plate Recognition

The Automatic License Plate Recognition project, implemented in MATLAB, automates the detection and recognition of vehicle license plates using image processing techniques. The system locates the license plate using an edge filter and edge histogram counter to identify the plate region. For character recognition, it uses template matching, comparing each character against fixed templates and recognizing the closest match. This process, which includes image preprocessing, plate localization, and character recognition, is designed for applications like traffic management, parking systems, toll booths, and surveillance, providing an efficient solution for vehicle identification.
